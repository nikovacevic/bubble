# Bubble: a platform for small communities
Bubble should provide small communities with a place to securely communicate, organize, and exist on the web.

## Founding idea

From [the blog post explaining idea](https://blog.nikovacevic.io/exploring-a-new-idea-bubble/) behind the project:
> I've begun exploring an idea: what would it mean to create a community platform that was anti-viral; that is, committed as a core principle to having useful boundaries within which something healthy can grow undisturbed. Want ads? No problem. Want to organize a group, publish a manifesto, plan events, and send direct messages? Go for it. Want to invite 6 billion people into one space? Not so fast.

## Guiding principles
### Keep it small
Smaller things have many advantages: higher social capital, lower volatility, simpler design, etc.
### Keep it simple
If it's simple, it will be easier to build, easier to understand, and easier to use.
### Keep it secure
If you can't trust it, what's the point?

## Documentation
- [Spec](docs/SPEC.md): API spec, data model, general design
- [Resource](docs/RESOURCES.md): repository for external documents, reference material, etc.
